# Group 1: Predicting Police Response Time 

### Nat Rubin, Kyla Hayworth, & Naomi Boss

This project is an attempt to fit a predictive model on police response time data in order to determine if population density, neighborhood race and income characteristics, and the call type have any significant influence on the time it takes for an officer to be dispatched and the time it takes for a dispatched officer to arrive to the call. We plan on fitting a model using Portland Police Bureau data as training data, and testing the model on different cities such as Los Angeles, Seattle, and Boston.
